# ðŸ§  EEG-based Dementia Classification

**Project â€“ Natural Interaction and Affective Computing (A.Y. 2024/2025)**  

This project explores the use of **deep learning neural networks** to recognize different forms of **dementia** (Alzheimer's and Frontotemporal) from **EEG signals**.  
The goal is to evaluate whether EEG can be used as an **accessible and non-invasive diagnostic tool**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze EEG signals from healthy subjects and subjects with dementia
- Compare different neural network architectures
- Evaluate the ability of models to distinguish between different diagnostic groups
